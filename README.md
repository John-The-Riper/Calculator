Assignment Details:
The next project that you will be working on is an infinite precision calculator. This calculator will be able to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers regardless of how large the numbers are. In an effort to keep the assignment description short, I have put the rationale in a separate document.

For the first part of this project, you are going to be creating the data structures necessary for this project. You will need to implement both a linked list and a linked stack.

Since the stack and the linked list will both be using nodes to store data, instead of having the node class be an inner class, we will have it be its own separate class. 

Below are the UML diagrams for the data structures:
